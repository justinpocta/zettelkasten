If there is not a target, one will spend time being distracted by unimportant tasks and problems.

If there are too many targets/goals/voices, it is still a challenge to divide up time.

Prioritizing requires alignment about a company's values.

The system of capitalism affects the realities a company might be able or be willing to take on, and whether or not all perspectives will be valued. (uh oh...*I feel jaded* by starting to contemplate the weight that statement carries.)

- [[A company cannot serve the perspective of one persons goals]]
- [[A company must listen to many perspectives to understand internally and externally what goals exist]]
