- [Joel Califa noted]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGIFpVik630](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGIFpVik630)) "People love shiny new things” and suggested that if people see a new feature, they'll 100% want it and do mind backflips trying to figure out how they'd use it…even if they would've told you, "that doesn't sound very interesting" had you asked at first.

## What Should We Remember
- We store memories differently based on how they were experience
- We reduce events and lists to their key elements
- We discard specifics to form generalities
- We edit and reinforce some memories after the fact

## Too Much Information
+ We notice things already primed in memory or repeated often 
	- [[Lean UX Research Tips - Joel Califa]] → On bias regarding people thinking more about a topic after a researcher asks about it - which is why one much ask general questions first, then specific, as not to stir up ideas and direct user feedback unintentionally
- Bizarre, funny, visually striking, or anthropomorphic things stick out more than non-bizarre/unfunny things
- We are drawn to details that confirm our own existing beliefs
- We notice flaws in others more easily than we notice flaws in ourselves
- We notice when something has changed

## Need to Act Fast
- To act, we must be confident we can make an impact and feel what we do is important
- We favor simple-looking options and complete information over complex, ambiguous options
- To avoid mistakes, we aim to preserve autonomy and group status, and avoid irreversible decisions
- To get things done, we tend to complete things we've invested time and energy in
- To stay focused, we favor the immediate, relatable thing in front of us

## Not Enough Meaning
- We project our current mindset and assumptions onto the past and future
- We think we know what other people are thinking
- We simplify probabilities and numbers to make them easier to think about
- We imagine things and people we're familiar with or fond of as better
- We fill in characteristics from stereotypes, generalities, and prior histories
- We tend to find stories and patterns even when looking at sparse data
