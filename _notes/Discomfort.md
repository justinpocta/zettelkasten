I started this morning with a client conversation about the discomfort inherent in the design process.  
  
So, have a quote from Conversational Design:  
> "Design is a machine for making new things in existing contexts, and for making old contexts obsolete. Instead of machining new factory tools, we fabricate processes and types of artifacts. The fundamental paradox of design is that the process by which we bring new things into the world can itself become a comfortable barrier to change. We work in the ways we know how to work. We need to balance the efficiency of mastery against the desire for novelty and the need for new solutions.Â "
