- **202208021456** - *I am realizing that as a write about customers, I am doing so from a very enterprise-y mindset with customer as a stakeholder at another company, using a product for their company's purposes. A consumer customer would bring about other aspects I may be overlooking here.*

My thought here ties to a few concepts:
- [[Trust is an important factor of communication]]
	- If a customer or even colleague does not trust you, they may withhold or avoid a topic as to protect themselves or you from a critique or concern
- [[Humans needs and desires are impacted by a variety of emotions, concerns, and]] 
	- #emotion #desire #need
	- Your experience with a person may not reflect their "true" self or thoughts, whether or not they intend for this (~ [[Johari Window]] perhaps?)
	- I'm interested in how the pandemic has affected individuals, particularly in professional settings where many may not feel able to be their complete self.
	- The number of meetings we have, the amount of time to take a breath, the distractions we have due to "remote life", etc etcâ€”many factors should be considered in terms of interactions and dynamics we give and receive to customers and colleagues.
- [[People respond a variety of ways based on their understanding of a question]]
	- #comprehension #meaning #interpretation 
	- Effective research can require asking a variety of questions to see the entire scope of a problem or process.
		- A response to a question can be affected by memory
		- A response to a question can be affected by one's experience of time (do they feel like they explain all the intricacies of a problem in the time they have available, in the rush they feel to answer the interviewer, et al?)
