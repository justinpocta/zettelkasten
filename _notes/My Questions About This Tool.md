**Site Tasks**
	- accordion for tags on tag page
	- RSS?
	- simpler header
	- redesign nav
	- develop [[Zettelkasten Note Types]] - fleeting, etc (rename á la digital gardens vernacular?) If I want this, I should re-add the original code for "Seasons" type
	- Comments can be enabled by connecting Disqus (will that add too much noise?)
	- Improve visibility of backlinks (content or only title?)
	- Filename = Title?

**Obsidian Tasks**
- Pull in snippets to better templatize your citations
- Sync better to iPad/iPhone

On Structure
- How do I believe Hubs should work vs notes? What are my rules?
- When does a Hub become generated? Before notes? After a collection of notes exist (which means I must hunt them down and update them)?

—-

- Can I use code to apply file name to content area?
- Why does search link notes back to Netlify when I'm on the subdomain? Config, code, or the DNS is still working?
- Can I use transclusion??
