Reminds me of the concept of "Forced Connections", a communication design method of joining two ideas by finding commonalities, particularly visually in relation to Identity Design/Symbols/Logos.

### What is Idea Emergence again?
> **Idea Emergence** is the process of how the ideas you encounter go from the “nothingness” to the “somethingness”—and how those ideas grow in richness, complexity, and personally meaningful value over time.
> 
> Idea Emergence is how things form from merging personal uniqueness with personal experiences.
> 
> Example given of Kate Bush 80s song and Stranger Things. Why is this emergence?
> -   Because it is distinct from the parts that make it up.
> -   And the parts still stand on their own.
> 
> **Start seeing your own Idea Emergence right now!**
> 
> Now here’s an exercise for you.
> - What are you working on right now? 
> - How are you encountering ideas and inspirations?
> - How are you merging them with your unique perspective?
> 
> If you need a prompt, try this:
> - _What’s something that got you really excited one day?_
> - Take a moment to think about a different time in your life.
> - Maybe you have a note about it. Maybe you just have a feeling.
> - It’s okay if it got buried for years.
> - Because just like “Running Up That Hill”, you can always “rediscover” your THING and merge it with your uniqueness to make an **_impact_** 💥 in your world.
> 
> Remember:
> - Without the Odyssey, there is no _Ulysses_.
> - That’s the wondrous power and unpredictability of **Idea Emergence**.
