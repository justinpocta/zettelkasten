**What do you want to validate?**
- Write up your Hypotheses, Assumptions, and Knowledge Gaps
	- ![[UXR-Github-Hypotheses and Assumptions and Gaps in Knowledge.png]]

**Assumptions/Gap Questions from General to Specific Levels → Types of Research**
- ![[UXR-Github-Question Types.png]]
- **High-Level Questions**
	- Usually best answered with user interviews
	- High-level questions have less to do with our specific implementation.
	- So other questions that could fit into this category might be, 
		- what are people's current workflows? 
		- How do teams collaborate? 
		- How do people think about GitHub, et cetera?
- **Mid-Level Questions**
	- These questions be either specific or not…
	- They have to do with both general workflows and with how we've implemented things.
- **Low-Level Questions**
	- Usually a great fit for usability testing with prototypes
	- generally have to do with whether specific things about our designs, interface, or flow, or nomenclature work for our users

---

- **Create a Research Plan** with how you can answer those questions with Interview Questions using one or more methods.
	- Interview Questions are **different** from your questions in your assumptions/gaps list. These interview questions exist to answer your **assumption** questions. But **how** you ask it of course will be different. E.g. “Is this a real problem for you?" is not a good research question to ask in an interview.

- **Select Research Methods**
	- **User interviews** are great for building high-level knowledge, for figuring out a general direction, and for sussing out real answers without biasing people. 
	- **Usability studies** are great for figuring out whether specific choices  you've made are intuitive.

Shipping =/= finished. It is opportunity to gather more info later.

**Vague → Specific**
- To help avoid tainting the information by "newness” of a feature, start more general
- Listen and Learn first, Show ideas secondarily.

## Research Tips
+ Give people an out.
	- they want to answer and please you. 
	- maybe they haven’t ever done the thing you’re asking about, give them a way to be A or B, not wrong if they don’t do the thing you’re asking about (pushing a Yes)
	- Being able to say "No" more easily means you get truer answers.

- Have you ever? 
- What **“Kinds of“** keeps the questions open, and then follow up on their answers to learn more
+ Ask same question different ways
	- Ask “What Kinds of Changes” AND “Tell me specific changes you suggested”
	- Ask question from a few different answers (like, with their role in a workflow—in his project a user could be a reviewer and have their code reviewed.) Semantic differences to gather more insights.
+ Make sure you get good data by **asking follow up questions**
	- ![[Tweet-Molly-Telford-Right-Questions.png]]
- Learn as much as you CAN, don't just check boxes of “YES OR NO?!”
+ What’s important is very subjective - free pass into how someone things (what's important to different types of users and why)
