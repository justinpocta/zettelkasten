"Companies don't build strategies solely on high-certainty beliefs. Uncertainty is a signal of opportunity—unless your competitors are out-learning you. No company in a competitive market will be sure about everything. You will likely be late if you wait for 100% certainty. But if you go charging ahead based on new, emergent assumptions, you may go terribly wrong (unless you call it out)."
