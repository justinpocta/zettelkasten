*This site exists as a nonlinear, emergent writing practice in pursuit of continuous growth and evolution as a designer*

I'm [Justin Pocta](http://justinpocta.com), a product designer in Dallas, TX. ðŸŒµ Welcome to my attempt at hosting my own [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten), a method of note taking focusing on the capture of small snippets of information which are **interlinked** to other snippets, with the goal of being discovery of relationships between ideas that are recognized by mixing and matching multiple snippets, which may not have been considered togther previously, to create new pathways of developing ideas and concepts. I also believe there is a value in seeing the relational structure and information architecture to help see existing or missing categories as a way to grow in your learning and perception of how things work.

My plan here is to pull from my usage [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md) (or other Markdown apps like [iA Writer](http://ia.net)) while writing on my mac and use Github to post content and [Netlify](http://netlify.com) to deploy it in a digestable format. We'll see if I can figure out what's going on without getting too side tracked from writing and develop my own UX process & ideologies.

This tool was built using [notenote.link](https://notenote.link) ðŸ¤˜, a fork ofÂ [Simply Jekyll](https://github.com/raghuveerdotnet/simply-jekyll). Its purpose is to allow a simple codebase to be compatible [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md) notes app so one can publish online simply. I'll be modifying the design overtime to fit it to my needs and interests as my writing develops.

Thanks for reading!
