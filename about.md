I'm [Justin Pocta](http://justinpocta.com), a product designer in Dallas, TX. ðŸŒµ Welcome to my attempt at hosting my own Zettelkasten (of sorts).

My plan here is to pull from my usage Obsidian (or other Markdown apps like [iA Writer](http://ia.net)) while writing on my mac and use Github to post content and [Netlify](http://netlify.com) to deploy it in a digestable format. We'll see if I can figure out what's going on without getting too side tracked from writing and develop my own UX process & ideologies.

This tool was built using [notenote.link](https://notenote.link), a fork ofÂ [Simply Jekyll](https://github.com/raghuveerdotnet/simply-jekyll). Its purpose is to allow a simple codebase to be compatible [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md) notes app so one can publish online simply. I'll be modifying the design overtime to fit it to my needs and interests as my writing develops.

Thanks for reading!
